Agronomist and Ph.D. in Plant Breeding. Assistant Professor in the **[Department of Genetics](http://www.genetica.esalq.usp.br/en/)** of the **["Luiz de Queiroz" College of Agriculture](https://en.esalq.usp.br/)**, **[University of S√£o Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/)**.

I'm very interested in plant breeding, statistical and quantitative genetics and solutions to integrate data science into plant breeding routines. I also love football and music (progressive rock/metal rules! ü§òüèΩ). 
Feel free to contact me if you got interested in any of my research fields, or you're feeling like talking to someone!
