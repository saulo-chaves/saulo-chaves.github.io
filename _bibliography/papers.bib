	abstract = {Abstract This study aimed to use the canopy replacement technique to reduce the field evaluation time and to select promising cupuassu tree clones. The study was carried out under field conditions using fifteen-year-old trees. The crowns were replaced using 16 treatments (clones). The experiment was conducted using randomized blocks design with 18 replicates and one plant per plot, during a period of ten years. The following variables were evaluated: average number of fruits, fruit, seed and pulp production (kg/plant) and symptoms of “witches broom” disease. The data were checked for normality followed by analysis of variance. The results highlighted clones 32, 42, 44, 46, 47, 61, 62, 63 and 64, presenting characteristics such as productivity, tolerance to witches’ broom disease and interesting fruit characteristics. The results demonstrate that the technique was effective in the evaluation of cupuassu tree genotypes, since the clones revealed their potential at early stages after establishment in the field. There was a reduction by at least 30\% regarding the time needed to evaluate cupuassu tree genotypes. Five clones (32, 42, 46, 61 and 64) already present the potential to be made available to producers, aimed at replacing the canopy of unproductive trees.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate and select progenies and matrices of cupuassu-tree siblings, and to select Brazilian mahogany matrices with superior characteristics to be used in agroforestry systems (AFS). Twenty-five full cupuassu tree sibling progenies and one Brazilian mahogany half-sibling progeny were evaluated. The study was conducted for 14 years in a commercial property in Tomé Açu, Pará State, Brazil. The number of fruits and fruit yield per plant, as well as the rate of plants with symptoms of witches’ broom disease, were used as response variables for cupuassu. For mahogany, the following response variables were used: total height, commercial height, crown height, diameter at breast height and commercial wood volume. There were five cupuassu tree progenies with interesting characteristics to be used in AFS. Based on the high values observed in the selection accuracy and heritabilities, a good potential for the selection of promising individuals in the cupuassu tree population is inferred. Based on the ranking of genotypic values and their agronomic performance, 10 matrices of cupuassu tree were selected. For Brazilian mahogany, three matrices showed excellent silvicultural performance. The matrices of these two species should be propagated vegetatively in order to evaluate clonal tests.},

	abstract = {Forest plantations are strong allies in preserving natural resources, providing social and economic benefits. The plantations carried out in the coming years will be vital to meet the growing demand for forest products. To ensure the continuity of genetic progress and the good results achieved with the improvement of forest species, statistical methods that accurately selects superior genotypes are desirable. Multi-trait multi-environment trials are preferred over single-trait single-environment trials, since they can exploit the covariance between traits and environments, increasing the analysis’s prediction power. The Bayesian multi-trait multi-environments approach (BMTME) combines the cited advantages with the parsimony of Bayesian statistics promoting a more informative data analysis. Thus, the aims of this study were to estimate genetic parameters, evaluate genetic variability, and select eucalyptus clones through BMTME models. To this end, a data set with 215 eucalyptus clones evaluated in four environments for diameter at breast height and Pilodyn penetration was used. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm was applied to estimate the variance components and genetic parameters and to predict the genotypic values. The Smith-Hazel index was used to simultaneously achieve gains with selection for both traits. The BMTME approach provided high accuracies, being a good strategy to the evaluation of multiple environmental trials of Eucalyptus for breeding purposes.},

					In fruit tree breeding, selection indices are used to identify the genotypes that combine desirable commercial and non-commercial characteristics. As Theobroma grandiflorum is generally cultivated in agroforestry systems (AFS), there is a need to develop cultivars that are adapted to such environments. In this study, the objective was to select the most promising genotypes for their future use in AFS based on the additive index, a pioneering method for this crop. The trial was carried out for 12 years in an agroforestry system in the municipality of Tomé-Açu, Pará State, Brazil. The 16 evaluated clones were completely randomised with a variable number of repetitions. The average number of fruits produced as well as the morpho-agronomic characteristics of the fruits were analysed. Mixed linear models were used to estimate the components of variance and predict the genotypic values. The genetic correlation between the variables was estimated, and the selection of genotypes was based on the additive index, with a positive orientation of all variables except the thickness of the fruit shells and the weight of the fruits. Clones 42, 44, 46, 47, 57, 61, and 64 performed well for all the analysed variables, resulting in a selection gain of 7.3\% and low incidence rates of witches’ broom disease. These genotypes can be made available to producers in the form of clones for use in AFS and can further be included in future hybridisations in T. grandiflorum breeding.},

The data obtained from the characterization were submitted to univariate and multivariate analysis of variance by the methods of principal components, correlation networks and established the divergence between the genotypes. The results showed that clone 46 had the highest seed and pulp masses, as well as fruits that excelled in average length, when compared to clones 32 and 61. Regarding vitamin C contents, clones 46, 61, 63 were superior compared to the other genotypes studied. These same clones, along with the 32 presented values higher than the quality reference standard proposed by the legislation in force. Thus, the tested clones presented characteristics suitable both for the pulp market (46, 61 and 64) and for the cupulate industry (32, 42 and 46), with pulp quality indexes higher than those determined by the Brazilian legislation.},

Both study areas (AFS and SF) were divided into five blocks. Sampling was carried out in two soil depths (0–20 cm and 20–40 cm), which was subjected to chemical analysis to determine the pH in water, contents of macro- and micronutrients, exchangeable bases, exchangeable aluminum, base saturation, cation exchange capacity and organic matter contents. As for the physical attributes, penetration resistance (PR) up to 40 cm deep in the soil was evaluated, using 50 randomized measurement per study area. The contents of macronutrients were higher in AFS, and the content of organic matter was higher in SF. The contents of micronutrients did not follow a specific pattern, and presented a similar distribution in both environments. The PR was higher in SF, showing a linear behavior that increases with increasing depths, while in AFS, there was a stabilization tendency within soil depth. Soil fertility was better in AFS, mainly due to the residual contents of periodic fertilization, in addition to presenting better conditions for root establishment.},

In multi-harvest data analyses, one frequently observes heteroscedasticity and genetic/statistical imbalance, which requires adequate statistical methods. This study aimed to (i) compare multi-harvest models with homogenous and heterogeneous residual variance, (ii) define the optimal number of harvests for an accurate genetic selection of T. grandiflorum genotypes, and (iii) select T. grandiflorum hybrid families with high fruit yield and resistance to witches’ broom using an additive index. We used a generalized linear mixed model to analyse the resistance to witches’ broom. The data refers to an unbalanced trial with 34 triple-cross hybrid families, arranged in a randomized complete block design. We evaluated these families throughout 9 consecutive harvest years regarding fruit yield and resistance to witches’ broom. The variance components, genetic parameters and genotypic values were estimated/predicted through residual maximum likelihood/best linear unbiased prediction methodologies. The model with heterogeneous residuals had a better fit than the homogeneous model for the fruit yield trait, according to Akaike information criterion. The results attest to the genetic variability in the evaluated population. To select the best individual for the next breeding cycle, three harvests are enough for selecting accurately for fruit yield and resistance to witches’ broom. For commercial release, nine harvests are necessary for both traits. We identified ten high-performance families regarding fruit yield and resistance to witches’ broom.},

This study aimed to evaluate different covariance structures for multi-harvest and multi-site trial analyses, using two datasets (D1 and D2). In D1, 25 hybrids of Theobroma grandiflorum were evaluated in a complete randomized block design, during twelve consecutive harvest years. In D2, 215 clones of Eucalyptus spp. were evaluated in a complete randomized block design, in four sites. For both datasets, the covariance structures of the random effects were modeled, and their adequacy was tested by the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria. From the selected model, the variance components and genetic parameters were estimated. We also compared the expected genetic gains and the rankings of genotypes based on the genotypic values provided by the basic and the selected models. For D1, the third-order factor analytic model was the most suitable for genetic effects, while for D2, the unstructured model showed the best fit for such effects. The models provided a better insight into the variances dynamics over the harvest years/sites. The genetic gains were 3.52 percentage points higher in D1 and did not change in D2. Despite similar results, the standard model, modeled with covariance structures that assume homogeneity of co-variances, was not the most statistically appropriate model for D2 according to the information criteria. Therefore, the modeling of covariance structures can and should be used in the genetic evaluation of perennial plants.},

Thus, the objectives of this study were to (a) evaluate homoscedastic and heteroscedastic repeatability models, (b) estimate the optimal number of harvest years for genetic selection, and (c) identify and select biparental crosses with high productivity, witches’ broom (Moniliophthora perniciosa Stahel \& Philips-Mora) resistance, stability, and adaptability. Twenty biparental crosses were evaluated in a complete randomized blocks design, with seven replications and 12 trees per plot for 10 harvest years. Evaluated traits were number of healthy fruits (NHF), number of symptomatic fruits for witches’ broom (NWBF), dry bean weight (DBW), and fruit index (FI). Variance components were estimated by restricted maximum likelihood, and genotypic values were predicted by best linear unbiased prediction. The best-fitted repeatability model for each trait was indicated by Akaike’s information criterion. The additive index was used for simultaneous selection for productivity, witches’ broom resistance, stability, and adaptability. The heteroscedastic repeatability model showed the best fit for all traits. For HF, WBF, and FI, two and seven harvest years were sufficient for selection aiming at recombination and recommendation, respectively. For NWBF, evaluated only from the seventh year onwards, one harvest year was enough for recombination and three for recommendation. Five biparental crosses with high productivity, witches’ broom resistance, stability, and adaptability were selected for recombination and/or for competition trials for recommendation. Such results can help define efficient strategies and optimize cacao breeding programs.},

Our goal was to select high-performance and stable hybrids using factor analytic selection tools (FAST) derived from FAMM outputs. Because the dataset comprised two different planting seasons, we also investigated differences in the genetic gains between seasonal and general selection (i.e., for both seasons simultaneously). The trials were installed in a lattice design with 36 hybrids containing two replicates and blocks with six plants each. We evaluated 53 hybrids and seven checks in 48 environments, represented by a combination of locations, years and seasons. We fitted the FAMMs with distinct sets of factors. The best-fitted FAMM was selected considering a parsimony-explained variance balance. Using the best FAMM for both seasonal and general analyses, we estimated the following selection tools: overall performance (OP); root mean square deviation (RMSD), which represents general stability; and responsiveness , which represents specific stability. We selected hybrids based on an index built with OP and RMSD. Five and three hybrids were selected considering both general and seasonal analyses for the first and second season, respectively. Two hybrids were amongst the top eight for both seasonal analyses (i.e., only first season and only second season simultaenously). Higher genetic gains may be obtained by employing FAMM and using FAST in each season rather than analysing both seasons in a joint fashion.},

For nine consecutive years, the fruit yield of these hybrids was evaluated. Each model had its goodness-of-fit tested by the Akaike information criterion. The most adequate model for estimating the variance components and the breeding values were modelled with the first-order heterogeneous autoregressive for residual effects and third-order factor analytic for genetic effects. From this model, we used the factor analytic selection tools for selecting the top 10 families, providing a genetic gain of 10.42\%.

	abstract = {Biotic and abiotic stresses have been making it difficult to maintain the rates of genetic gains in forest tree breeding. Planting a mixture of genotypes or clonal composites can be an alternative to increase the security of forest plantations. The formation of clonal composites is complex due to inter-genotypic competition and indirect genotypic effects that can affect the efficiency of genetic selection. This study aims to understand how indirect genotypic effects can impact the response to selection and how the stand composition can be used to explore these effects and enhance forest yield. We used two clonal trials of eucalyptus hybrids implanted in a randomized complete block design with 24 replications, containing a single tree per plot evaluated for mean annual increment at 3 and 6 years. We focused on partitioning the genotypic variation into direct and indirect genotypic effects based on competition intensity factors. We identified aggressive, homeostatic, and sensitive clones based on the magnitude of indirect genotypic effects. Considering indirect genotypic effects, for mean annual increment, the total heritability decreased from 0.25 to 0.10 for 3 years and from 0.30 to 0.14 for 6 years, respectively. We proposed a workflow that uses the direct and indirect genotypic effects to predict the mean values for clonal composite combinations and to select the one with the highest yield. Our methodology considered spatial variation and interplot competition that can affect the total heritable estimates and response to selection in forest trials. The clones were classified as aggressive, homeostatic, and sensitive, according to their deviation from the indirect genotypic effects means. Our methodology enabled the extraction of useful information and predict many clonal composites' performance, which can be used in recommending genotypes to be planted in mixtures.},

					Multi-trait multi-environment (MTME) models were fitted to eucalyptus breeding trials data to assess residual variance structure, genetic stability and adaptability. To do so, 215 eucalyptus clones were evaluated in a randomized complete block design with 30 replicates and one plant per plot in four environments. At 36 months of age, tree diameter at breast height (DBH) and pilodyn penetration (PP) were measured. Two MTME models were fitted, for which residuals were considered homoscedastic and heteroscedastic, with the best MTME model selected using Bayesian information criterion. The harmonic mean of the relative performance of the genotypic values (HMRPGV) was used to determine stability and adaptability. Of the two models, the heteroscedastic MTME model had better fit and provided greater accuracy. In addition, genotype-by-environment interaction was complex, and there was low genetic correlation between DBH and PP. Rank correlation between the clones selected by the MTME models was high for DBH but low for PP. The HMRPGV facilitated clone selection through simultaneous evaluation of stability, adaptability, and productivity. Thus, our results suggest that heteroscedastic MTME model / HMRPGV can be efficiently applied in the genetic evaluation and selection of eucalyptus clones.},

The aim was to understand the genetic dynamics over ten harvest years and select high-performing genotypes. The trial was conducted in Ouro Preto D’Oeste, Rondônia, Brazilian Amazon. Twenty biparental cacao crosses were evaluated over ten years using random regression models. Models with different polynomial degrees and covariance structures for the residual effects were compared, and the best model was determined using Akaike Information Criterion. We also compared the genetic gains after selecting using three criteria: breeding values, persistence, and area under genotypic trajectories. The best random regression models differed between traits. Genotype-by-harvest interactions were observed, emphasizing the temporal variability in genotype performance. Genetic correlations across harvests illustrated the dynamic nature of genetic expression. Accuracy and heritability fluctuated over successive harvests, emphasizing the complexity of genotype performance prediction. Non-linear genotypic trajectories revealed the presence of unique genetic attributes associated with each trait, with number of healthy fruits showing a tendency towards standardization and dry bean weight displaying a more complex pattern. Consistency in selecting genotypes based on number of healthy fruits highlights reliable selection. Conversely, the variability in choosing top genotypes for dry bean weight underscores the need for cautious selection strategies, as it is a more complex trait to optimize. Despite these insights, future research should consider specific environmental conditions, management practices, and the integration of genomic information for a more comprehensive understanding of genetic dynamics in cacao breeding.},

The trial was carried out in a greenhouse, in a completely randomized design with a 16 x 2 (16 progenies and two water regimes) factorial scheme and four replications. Treatments started six months after the seedlings were transplanted. 15 traits related to vegetative development, biomass accumulation and physiology were measured for the experimental evaluation. Correlations and principal components were estimated to study the traits’ interrelationships and identify the most important to assist progeny selection. The results revealed that, among the evaluated traits, ten were sufficient to explain the variability within the population and four were elected as the most relevant to select the best progenies. 75\% of the genotypes showed tolerance to partial flooding and based on performance and plasticity, we selected G174, G48 and G56 for a broader spectrum and G44, G47 and G51 for hypoxic conditions only.

Cocoa production is directly related to water availability, and, as climate changes, selecting drought-tolerant genotypes is vital to keep cacao crops sustainable. Here, we evaluated cacao genotypes under irrigated and water-stressed conditions and selected drought-tolerant ones based on nutritional and physiological traits. Thirty-nine genotypes were monitored for three years for agronomic traits and higher fruit yield. After this evaluation, the 18 most promising genotypes were evaluated in a randomized block design, under a 2 (with and without irrigation) \$\${\textbackslash}times\$\$ 18 (genotypes) factorial arrangement, with three replicates and five plants per plot. We evaluated seven physiological and 11 nutritional traits, selecting genotypes based on the Genotype-by-Trait Biplot approach. Significant effects (p {\textless} 0.05) were observed for the nutritional traits N, P, Mg, S, Zn, Cu, Mn and for the physiological traits CO2 assimilation rate (A), stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration (E), intercellular and atmospheric CO2 concentrations (Ci/Ca), intrinsic water use efficiency (A/gs), instantaneous water use efficiency (A/E), and instantaneous carboxylation efficiency (A/Ci), as determined by analysis of variance. The genotype \$\${\textbackslash}times\$\$ irrigation treatment interaction was significant (p {\textless} 0.05) for the traits A, gs, and E. Genotypes CP 41, CP 43, and CCN 51 exhibited superior performance for both nutritional and physiological traits (A, gs, and E). In the irrigated environment, CP 41 showed superiority in traits such as P, A/E, A/gs, Mn, S, and Zn. Conversely, under non-irrigated conditions, CP 43 exhibited better performance in nutritional properties, specifically Mn, Mg, and Zn. Notably, in both irrigated and non-irrigated environments, CCN 51 excelled in key physiological traits, including A/Ci, A/E, and A/gs. This robust performance across diverse conditions suggests that these three genotypes possess physiological mechanisms to endure water-stressed conditions. Our research can generate valuable insights into these genotypes informing suitable choices for cocoa cultivation, especially in the context of global climate change.},

The aims of this study were to compare the goodness-of-fit of the model and the genotype ranking through different residual modeling approaches and to select the best performing tropical wheat genotypes based on the best-fitting model. A panel of tropical wheat genotypes was evaluated in three field trials conducted between 2020 and 2021 for grain yield. Linear mixed model analyses were used on the data to estimate the genetic parameters and to predict the genotypic values in analyses of single- and multi-environment trials. Accounting for spatial trends in the analyses of single- and multi-environment trials provides better outcomes than the compound symmetry model does.},

The occurrence of genetic and/or statistical imbalance is common in these experiments, in addition to the possibility of (co)variance between genetic and non-genetic effects. We explore the restricted maximum likelihood/best linear unbiased prediction features to select the model with the most appropriated covariance structure and compare the results with the traditional model (homogenous variances and no covariances). Then, 17 inbred lines and three cultivars were evaluated in six experiments during two crop years in the semiarid zone of Northeast Brazil. The trait evaluated was the 100-grain weight. We selected the best model considering the Akaike Information Criterion. The model with diagonal structure for the residual effects and heterogeneous compound symmetry for the genetic effects had the best fit. The predicted genetic gain of lines selected in this model was 1.18\% higher compared to the traditional model. Modeling different (co)variance structures for genetic and non-genetic effects is an efficient approach in selecting superior genotypes in multi-environment trials in cowpea breeding.},

The investigation explores the nuances interplay of GEI and extends its insights by scrutinizing the relationship between latent factors and real environmental features. The analysis, conducted across seven trials in five Brazilian states involving 78 clones, employs FAST. The clonal selection was performed using an extended FAST index weighted by the clone’s reliability. Further insights about GEI emerge from the integration of factor loadings with 25 environmental features through a principal component analysis. Ten clones, distinguished by high performance, stability, and reliability, have been selected across the target population of environments. The environmental features most closely associated with factor loadings, encompassing air temperature, radiation, and soil characteristics, emerge as pivotal drivers of GEI within this dataset. This study contributes insights to eucalyptus breeders, equipping them to enhance decision-making by harnessing a holistic understanding-from the genotypes under evaluation to the diverse environments anticipated in commercial plantations.},

	abstract = {Key message: Eucalyptus breeding can beneﬁt from strategies that capture dominance effects, as shown by the improvement in mean annual increment of wood volume across cycles of RRS. Abstract: There is no empirical validation of reciprocal recurrent selection (RRS) in Eucalyptus breeding. Our study helps to ﬁll this gap by quantifying the realized response to selection achieved after two cycles of RRS involving Eucalyptus urophylla and E. grandis. We also investigated the selection effects on the genetic parameters of the breeding populations. We evaluated 25 trials of the ﬁrst cycle (C1) of RRS and 12 trials of the second cycle (C2) of RRS. These trials were established in two different regions, separated according to altitude. Fitting linear mixed models enabled the estimation of variance components and the prediction of mean components (general and speciﬁc hybridizing abilities). The realized response to selection was calculated as the difference between the mean of the predicted genotypic values of the C1 and C2. The RRS effectively improved the mean annual increment of wood volume by 28.5\% in the high-altitude region and 12.3\% in the low-altitude region from the C1 to C2. The genetic variability also increased as a result of the new genotypes that arose through recombination. These ﬁndings provide insights for decision-making and reinforce that Eucalyptus breeding can beneﬁt from strategies that capture dominance effects.},

The VIs were accessed at various stages of crop development and correlated with agronomic performance traits. The field research was conducted in the experimental area of the Mato Grosso do Sul Foundation, Brazil, with 60 soybean pure lines. RGB images were captured at multiple stages of development (28, 37, 49, 70, 86, 105, 115, and 120 days after sowing). We used a linear mixed effects model, with restricted maximum likelihood (REML)/best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) methods, to estimate variance components and genetic correlations, and to predict genotypic values. Significant genetic differences were identified among genotypes for all agronomic traits evaluated (p{\textless} 0.001), with high accuracy and heritability for plant height, maturity at R8, and 100-seed weight. There was a significant genotype \$\${\textbackslash}times\$\$flight data interaction impact on VI expression, emphasizing the importance of timing data collection to enhance HTP with VIs in agronomic performance evaluation. In the early stages, the indices varied depending on the environment. On the other hand, the indices showed higher correlations with the traits of plant height and maturity at the R8 stage, at 105, 115, and 120 days after sowing. HTP with VIs based on RGB images from UAVs has proven to be more effective in the early and final stages of soybean development, providing essential information for the selection of superior genotypes. This study highlights the importance of the temporal approach in HTP, optimizing the selection of soybean genotypes and refining agricultural management strategies.},

	abstract = {Genetic competition can obscure the true merit of selection candidates, potentially leading to altered genotype rankings and a divergence between expected and actual genetic gains. Despite a wealth of literature on genetic competition in plant and animal breeding, the separation of genetic values into direct genetic effects (DGE, related to a genotype’s merit) and indirect genetic effects (IGE, related to the effects of a genotype’s alleles on its neighbor's phenotype) in linear mixed models is often overlooked, likely due to the complexity involved. To address this, we introduce gencomp, a new R package designed to simplify the use of (spatial-) genetic competition models in crop and tree breeding routines. gencomp includes functions for constructing the genetic competition matrix, fitting (spatial-) genetic competition models via the variance-component approach, and extracting key results such as variance components, heritabilities, competition classes, and total genetic values. For tree breeding, gencomp also calculates the merit of different clonal mixtures using the estimated DGE and IGE of the selection candidates. In this paper, we first present the theoretical foundation of the methods implemented in the package. We then demonstrate the use of gencomp with two datasets: one simulated from a Eucalyptus spp. trial and a real potato dataset. We used both datasets to demonstrate the influence of genetic competition in variance component estimates, heritabilities and selection. Despite the dependency on ASReml-R, a paid resource, gencomp is a user-friendly tool that can popularize genetic competition models, contributing to more informed decision-making in plant breeding.},

	abstract = {General combining ability (GCA) is the major selection criterion for new sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas) parents in a reciprocal recurrent selection (RRS) scheme. Here we aimed to estimate GCA and specific combining ability (SCA) by using 16 potential testers involved in an 8 × 8 partial diallel and propose a procedure to identify testers in sweetpotato breeding. Data on storage root yield in tons per hectare (rytha), and sweetpotato virus disease (vir2) from 64 families (1,913 clones) were collected in five trials at two locations in Uganda. The estimates of the female GCA accounted for the largest additive genetic variation for storage root yield compared to the male GCA for both traits. Mid-parent heterosis ranged from − 6.2 to 7\% for rytha, and − 1.1 to 1.3\% for vir2 in the progeny families. A stepwise procedure to identify testers top-ranked ‘NASPOT 7’ as a dual tester for both traits. Besides this parent, ‘Ejumula’ and ‘NASPOT 10 O’ for rytha, and ‘NASPOT 1’, ‘NK259L’, ‘SPK004’, and ‘NASPOT 11’ for vir2 are particularly suitable as respective single-trait testers. Testers are important in many plant breeding programs to enhance efficiency of RRS, and thus other crop species might benefit from the strategy and methods applied herein.},
